üë®üèº‚Äçüîß Discord server management has never been easier!

</div>

## ‚ÅâÔ∏è Why?

In the new context of the pandemic, many educational institutions have shifted their courses online, with the use of communication platforms like Discord. However, managing multiple roles and channels across a Discord server is challenging : there are no way to centrally visualize the information nor to apply synchronized permissions updates. This tool allows you to define a single configuration file to be applied to a server, and it will automatically find the changes that needs to be made, ensuring that your Discord will always be in synch with your config.

## ‚≠ê Features

- üìú **Diff current Discord server config with your desired one**
- üèóÔ∏è **Apply large scale changes to your Discord server**
- ‚ö° **Fast, secure and reliable**

## Modules

- [disma](./disma) : Core Rust library for defining configuration as code and controlling your own orchestrations and implementations.
- [disma-cli](./disma-cli) : A stable and easy to use command line interface for defining configuration as simple YAML files. Still allows for templating to simplify the configuration.
