# Disma - Command line tool

- [‚òëÔ∏è Prerequisites](#Ô∏è-prerequisites)
- [üöÄ Commands](#-commands)
- [‚öôÔ∏è Guild configuration file](#Ô∏è-guild-configuration-file)

## ‚òëÔ∏è Prerequisites

### 1. Install the CLI

#### Method 1 : with `cargo`

```shell
cargo install disma-cli
```

To validate installation, run :

```shell
disma
```

#### Method 2 : standalone

Not yet available.

### 2. Create and get a Discord bot token

If you don't have created a bot yet, here's how to do it :

1. Go to <https://discord.com/developers/applications>, login and create an application.
2. Go to the created application, click on `Bot` on the sidebar and create a bot.
3. Go to the created Bot page and copy the token (might need to create it first).
   - :warning: **Don't forget to save the token** (in the environment variable `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` for Disma).

> P.S.: The same bot can be used for all of your Discord servers :wink:

### 3. Add a bot to a Discord server (guild)

If your bot hasn't been already added to the server that you want to manage with Disma, here's how do add it :

1. On your bot's application page, go to `OAuth2` on the sidebar
2. In the `General` section, add a placeholder Redirect URL (can be `http://localhost`) and Save
3. In the `URL Generator` section, select the `identify` scope. A new section for the redirect URL will appear, make sur to select one.
4. Then also select the `bot` scope. A new pannel with Permissions will appear. Disma only needs the `Manage Roles` and `Manage Channels` permissions, so you can select those.
   - If you only want to test the bot for saving configs, you can leave all permissions unselected.
5. Navigate to the generated URL at the bottom of the page. This will bring you to an auth page, asking you to choose which server to add your bot to.
6. Confirm and your bot should have been added to your server!

> P.S.: You will need to redo those steps for every server

> P.P.S.: You can change the bot's permissions directly in the Server Settings without redoing all those steps :wink:

To validate the bot's read access, run :

```shell
disma list
```
